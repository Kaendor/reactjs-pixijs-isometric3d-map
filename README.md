## Work In Progress

This project is a work in progress.
There will be massive changes in the near future.
For example, there will be more than 1 React component.

There is only 1 available set of data (`grand_canyon_200.json`) for now, which has been kind of randomly fetched.
The current result doesn't match my expectations yet. Mostly because it doesn't look like the Grand Canyon. At all.

But things will get better!
